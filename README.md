# Iris Classification
Classifying Iris species in the classic Iris dataset

### Approach
In order to increase the accuracy of the predictions, I engineered extra features. The features added were the petal and sepal area. Overall, it did not have a great impact on the best accuracy I achieved, however it did increase my baseline accuracy from 89%-92% to approxmiately 94%.

### Results
The best result achieved was 100%. However, that is dependent on how the dataset was shuffled. The accuracy ranged from 94%-100%
